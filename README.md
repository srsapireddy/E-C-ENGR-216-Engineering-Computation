The terms interpreter and compiler refer to two different approaches to executing or translating source code into a format the computer can execute. Here's a detailed comparison:

### 1. Definition
* Interpreter: Translates and executes code line-by-line or statement-by-statement. It does not produce a standalone executable file. </br>
* Compiler: Translates the entire source code into a standalone executable file before execution. The program can be run later without the compiler. </br>
### 2. Execution Process 
* Interpreter: Reads the source code and executes it directly.</br>
Example: Python, Ruby, and JavaScript interpreters.</br>
* Compiler: Converts source code into machine code (binary).</br>
The compiled program can then be executed without further translation.</br>
Example: C, C++, and Go compilers.</br>
